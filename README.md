Reinforcement Learning in Control Systems: Theory and Implementation
Welcome to this repository dedicated to exploring Reinforcement Learning (RL) in control systems. This project aims to showcase how RL can be applied to dynamic systems and compare its performance with traditional PID controllers.

Project Overview
This repository contains a detailed explanation of Reinforcement Learning (RL), its core concepts, and its advantages over traditional control systems. It also includes a comparison between PID controllers and RL and demonstrates how both can be used in real-world applications, such as seesaw control and smart building temperature management.

If you're new to Reinforcement Learning, you'll find a theory.txt file that provides an in-depth look at RL principles, its components, and how it's used to control dynamic systems. It also highlights the differences between RL and PID controllers, showing where RL excels in dynamic, uncertain environments.

Key Concepts
Reinforcement Learning (RL): A method where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
PID Controllers: A classical control method that uses proportional, integral, and derivative actions to control a system.
Comparing RL and PID: We delve into how RL can be more adaptive and efficient than PID, especially in complex systems.
Why This Project?
Reinforcement Learning has the potential to optimize systems in ways that traditional methods like PID controllers cannot. In this repository, we explore how RL is applied to practical problems such as balancing a ball on a seesaw and controlling building temperatures in a smart city.

The comparison between RL and PID shows how RL can learn from experience, adapt to environmental changes, and continuously optimize its performance.
